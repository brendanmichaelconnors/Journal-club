# Journal-club

**Who**: DFO staff (incl. postdocs) from PBS and IOS who are interested in discussing new literature, ideas, analytical tools and approaches, as well as (occasionally) engaging in collaborative research/side projects. See examples below of some recent papers that I thought might be interesting to discuss.

**What**: Rotating chair selects paper/topic and leads/instigates a group discussion in whatever format she/he deems appropriate.

**Where**: PBS

**When**: 1 hr, preferably in the am, once per month, in the fall and winter (e.g., third Friday of each month)
